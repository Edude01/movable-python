The **Movable Python** GUI has a shiny big button marked **IDE** on it. This launches an IDE [#]_. {sm;:-)}

The default IDE which comes with Movable Python is `Pythonwin <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32>`_ [#]_.

Configuring an IDE

You can configure which IDE is launched through the *Choose IDE* menu option. For example you can download `SPE <http://pythonide.stani.be/>`_ for Movable Python from the `Movable Python Extra Files <http://www.tradebit.com/usr/voidspace/files.php/7007>`_ page. Other IDEs, like `Ulipad <http://wiki.woodpecker.org.cn/moin/UliPad>`_ will probably work with Movable Python.

The choose IDE dialog allows you to select a file to be used as the IDE (Python file, executable or batch file) and any arguments to be passed to it.

If the IDE is a Python file it will be launched without a console. You currently can't configure things like the directory that the script is run in.

.. [#] The IDE is always launched with the default interpreter for the version of Movable Python that you are running.
.. [#] Currently there is a minor incompatibility between Movable Python and Pythonwin. The 'browse' button on the 'Run' dialog has been disabled.
