Introduction
============

This is the changelog for the early versions of **Movable Python**. It shows the development of Movable Python from an interesting experiment, into a useful tool. More details on the people involved can be found in `CREDITS <CREDITS.html>`_.


CHANGELOG
=========

2005/03/28      Version 0.4.7
-----------------------------

No longer print tracebacks for ``sys.exit``.

SPE 0.7.3 is now used.

IPython 0.6.12


2005/02/07      Version 0.4.6
-----------------------------

Movpy Icon and image added by Aidan Ashby - 
`www.nebulae.org.uk <http://www.nebulae.org.uk>`_

We use exec rather than eval (which shouldn't be used with `multiple statement 
code objects`).

IPython isn't called if ``-p`` is on, psyco and IPython don't play well
together.

IPython won't be called if ``psyco.full()`` has been called in your script.

Fixed a bug in Python 2.2 support - ``exclude_modules`` now works !

Forced package import for encodings. SPE now works with python 2.2 - but still
'experimental'.

Icon is now used in python 2.2

The pre-built environments use newer versions of readline, IPython, and
SPE.


2005/01/17      Version 0.4.5
-----------------------------

Make sure multi-line statements we compile terminate in ``'\n'``. (Fixes a bug
when run in Python 2.2)

Removed the 'module_extensions' keyword.

Added logging using `StandOut <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/standout.html>`_ and the 'logfile' keyword.  

Module exclusion now works with py2exe.

Added the optimize and compressed keywords. (not relevant to Python 2.2)

Fixed ``sys.winver``.

Added the 'build_full' and removed the 'include_dirs' keywords (greatly 
simplified the 'search path' code in PyDistFreeze.py).

Identified problems with pywin32 with help from Brian Beck (``del sys.frozen``
sometimes useful !).

Added code to build environments with win32com - see 
http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/moin.cgi/WinShell

The 'lib/' directory is now in sys.path when entering interactive mode 
immediately (bug spotted by Bruno).

Distribution description includes the version of python. 

2005/01/02      Version 0.4.4
-----------------------------

When not using IPython, interactive() will find locals() for itself. (Meaning interactive() can be called in user scripts).

Added the 'manuals' folder to the distribution.

Added the ``-p`` command line option, to switch on psyco.

Switched to using compile/eval rather than exec/execfile. (Better for psyco *and* more meaningful error messages)

A fix so that errors will report the right line number with '``-x``'.

Changed config file to include winsound and unicodedata.

Modifications to PyDistFreeze.py and movpy.py to make them compatible with python 2.2.

A built in 'setup.py' for python 2.2. (can now autobuild distributions on python 2.2)

IPython should now work on machines that don't have it installed ! (ipythondir is now set and config file supplied)

If you don't select a file from the GUI, it now drops into interactive mode.

Can supply path to config.txt in command line to PyDistFreeze.py

Tweaked the directory finding function - which finds directories we will search.

Fixed it so that movpyw doesn't generate error logs with '-' if launched from GUI with no file.

IDLE now works, so added idle.bat.

2004/12/31      Version 0.4.3
-----------------------------

Support for IPython as alternative interactive shell.

External config file ('config.txt' in 'lib/' directory) - for setting default 
command line options.

Added 'credits' and 'copyrights' as builtins (for IPython).

2004/12/29      Version 0.4.2
-----------------------------

Added support for command line arguments -h, -V, -u, -i, -x, -, -c (hey that's a lot for one evening  !)

The main script 'movpy.py' is now kept in an external file.

'include_modules' now supports sub-packages.

Added back support for encodings.

packagepaths.pth added for sub-package support with 'include_packages'. 

2004/12/28      Version 0.4.1
-----------------------------

Lots of changes , they include :

* addition of customize.py
* addition of syspaths.pth

* Addition of unicows dll is optional
* Addition of spe.bat

2004/12/19      Version 0.4
-----------------------------

* Lightweight GUI frontend added to movpy.exe
* setup.py incorporated into main script - name changes to PyDistFreeze.py

2004/12/18      Version 0.3
---------------------------

More work with Stani.

* '.pth' files now supported
* Importing from '.pyc' etc. as well as straight '.py' files
* Added external config file, using `ConfigObj <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html>`_

2004/12/17      Version 0.2
---------------------------

Renamed 'Movable Python'. (Executable is 'movpy.exe')

Cleaned up a lot - now imports subpackages properly.

Thanks to Stani of SPE for encouragement and suggestions. (including the name)

2004/12/14      Version 0.1
---------------------------

Test version called 'testenv' - Python test environment.

Works better than expected.

Thanks to Bruno Thoorens and Stani for help and debugging.
