Introduction
============

This page is the list of known issues with **Movable Python**. They aren't
bugs, but potential problems with **Movable Python** and things you should be
aware of when running programs.

Most of them relate to using third party extensions.

Some of the issues here include slight differences between the **Movable Python**
environment and the normal Python environment. In rare cases these can affect
the running of applications.

As issues (and fixes) are discovered they will be documented here. If you think
you have discovered a problem, raise it on the 
`Mailing List <http://groups.google.com/group/movpy/>`_ and we'll search for a
solution.

The Issues
==========


* IPython plays very badly with psyco. This is because psyco prevents local
  variables in functions being accessed. Try entering interactive mode and
  typing '``import psyco``', followed by '``psyco.full()``' to see what I mean.
  Movable Python now detects when psyco is in operation and uses the alternative
  (less featured) interactive mode instead.

* ``sys.executable`` and ``sys.prefix`` (and ``sys.exec_prefix``) are different
  for scripts run by Movable Python than they would be for a script run by
  normal python. You can manually alter these values in ``customize.py`` if you
  need to. (Obviously modifying ``sys.executable`` isn't wise.)

* Some programs rely on the executable being called ``python.exe`` (or 
  ``pythonw.exe``). Occassionally these names are hardwired on the code (which
  ought to use ``sys.executable``).

* Some code relies on a certain directory structure of Python installations -
  for example the existence of a *site-packages* folder. This obviously doesn't
  work with **Movable Python**.

* ``sys.frozen`` exists - which it *wouldn't* do for a normal python script.
  This can be an issue for some packages (like the win32 packages) which will
  assume they are in a py2exe environment (and directory structure). See 
  `win32ext <win32ext.html>`_ for more details on this issue.

* '-' will generate an error log if you try it with ``movpyw.exe`` (quite 
  rightly so !)

* import statements in ``.pth`` files aren't supported. (Setuptools uses these.)

* The normal distributions don't use  bytecode optimisation or compress the
  ``library.zip``.

* Saving a config file overwrites comments in the original.

* The section for handling command line options doesn't deal with duplicate
  entries.
