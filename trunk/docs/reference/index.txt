Introduction
============

   :alt: The Movable Python GUI
   :class: image
   :align: center

**Movable Python**, as well as being a portable version of Python, has a lot of functionality built into it. Some of this functionality is exposed via the `command line <command_line.html>`_, but a lot of it is only relevant from the GUI.

To use Movable Python, double click on ``movpy.exe`` or ``movpyw.exe``. This will launch the GUI.

.. note::

    **Movable Python** does not need installing.
    
    To use, unzip the folder and go to the ``movpy`` folder. It can be run from any folder, including a USB memory stick or flash card.

This page covers the major elements of the GUI, and point to the relevant pages for features which merit further explanation. {sm;:-)}

Menus

Movable Python has various menu option. Some of them correspond to controls on the GUI. See the `Menus <menus.html>`_ page for more details.


Script Controls
===============

   :height: 34
   :width: 349
   :alt: The Script Controls
   :class: image
   :align: center

The first row of controls on the GUI are directly related to choosing and launching scripts.


Launch
------

This button brings up a file dialog to select a script. It will be run immediately on selection.


Script
------

This text box takes a path to a script, relative to the Movable Python directory. It is also a drop-down list containing previous scripts.

Folder Icon
-----------

This icon brings up a file dialog to choose a script. The path to the file you choose will be placed in the script text box.

Green Arrow
-----------

This will run the file in the script text box.


Options and Args
================

   :alt: The Options and Arguments
   :class: image
   :align: center


Configure
---------

This brings up the full `options <options.html>`__ dialog. These configure the options that scripts are run with, most of these equate to `command line <command_line.html>`_ options.


Args
----

Anything you put in this text box will be passed to scripts you run as command line arguments.


Options
-------

These check boxes allow you to easily set and unset the most commonly used `options <options.html>`__.

These are :

* ``f``

    Force script to run in its own directory, rather than the current directory.

* ``p``

    Run scripts with psyco enabled.

* ``b``

    Pause (break) after running scripts. (For non-Movable Python interpreters this will cause them to be run in a command console which drops down to the console after running.)

* ``i``

    Enter an interactive interpreter session when the program exits.


Quick Launch Buttons
====================

   :class: image
   :align: center


Movable Python provides eight quick launch buttons. These allow you to configure programs that you use frequently to be launched with a single push of a button (including setting options and passing command line arguments).

These can be setup through the `Quick Launch Dialog <guick_launch.html>`_.


IDE and Interactive Interpreter
===============================

   :height: 120
   :width: 52
   :alt: The IDE and Interactive Interpreter Buttons
   :class: image
   :align: center

These two buttons launch an interactive interpreter session or an IDE.


Interpreter
-----------

Clicking on the button marked ``>>>`` will launch an interactive interpreter session for the currently selected interpreter.

By default Movable Python uses `IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org/>`_ for the interactive interpreter. You can switch this off with the ``IPOFF`` option.


IDE
---

   :height: 380
   :width: 540

   :class: image
   :align: center

Movable Python comes with the `pythonwin <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32>`_ {acro;IDE}.

You can use the `IDE <ide.html>`__ dialog to configure which program is launched by the IDE button.
