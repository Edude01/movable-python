 Customizing Movable Python
============================
----------------------------
 Changing Your Distribution

There are lots of ways you can customize your **Movable Python** distribution.
You might want to do any of the following things :

1) Add extension modules that you need
2) Remove unneeded modules to reduce the distribution size
3) Add paths to ``sys.path``
4) Customize the environment your programs run in

Items 3 and 4 can be done through editing ``customize.py`` and ``syspaths.pth``, a couple of the `Special Files <special_files.html>`_.

This page discusses how you can do items 1 and 2.

.. caution::

    As you customize your distribution, don't change the executable names.
    
    **Movable Python** relies on the executable being called ``movpy.exe`` or
    ``movpyw.exe``.


Adding Extension Modules
========================

It is likely that you will want to add extension modules to your 
**Movable Python** distribution.

These should be added to the ``movpy/lib/`` folder, which acts as the equivalent
of the ``site-packages`` folder in a normal Python distribution.

If the modules you want to add are pure Python modules, you can just copy them
straight into this folder.

If the module is a compiled extension module (``.pyd`` or ``.dll``) then it
must be compiled for the version of Python your **Movable Python** distribution
uses.

The easiest way of doing this is to copy the files from a normal Python
installation. If this isn't possible (you don't have that version of Python
installed anywhere), then `contact me <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cgi-bin/contact/contact.py>`_.
So long as the extension is freely available for that version of Python I can
probably help.

.. note::

    Some Python extension modules are distributed as ``.exe`` files. These use
    a ``zip`` compatible form. You can use a program like `Winrar <http://www.rarlabs.org>`_
    to extract the files from the exectuable.
    

pth Files
---------

Some extension modules create ``.pth`` files in ``site-packages`` when they are
installed. This adds paths to ``sys.path``, which Python uses to find modules.

You can add the *contents* of these files to the ``syspaths.pth`` [#]_
`Special File <special_files.html>`_.

If you don't do this then code will fail to find modules when it needs them.


Eggs
----

Python is not yet compatible with `easy_install <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_ from `setuptools <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_.

You can still use uncompressed eggs with Movable Python. Just put the egg directory into the ``lib`` directory and add the egg directory to ``syspaths.pth``.


Reducing Distribution Size
==========================

A lot of space is taken up by the extension modules provided with
**Movable python**. If you want to reduce the space taken up by the
distribution, a lot of these files can be safely deleted.

In the `Distribution Contents <../distributions.html#distribution-contents>`_
section it tells you what packages are included, and gives you some information
about dependencies. For example, ctypes and readline are used by IPython and enchant is used for spell checking by Firedrop2.

By far the biggest extension is wxPython. The ``wx-2.7.1-msw-unicode`` directory
is over twenty megabytes.

If you don't need wxPython, then you can also remove ``wax`` and
``firedrop2`` as they won't work without wxPython anyway. {sm;:-)}

``enchant`` is nearly seven megabytes, and is used by the Spell Checker plugin
for ``firedrop2``.

.. caution::

    ``tcl`` is used by the GUI, which is written with Tkinter. If you delete
    this, the GUI will fail to run.
    
    Other than ``tcl``, none of the sub-directories of the ``lib`` directory
    are *required* to run **Movable Python**.

A minimal distribution can be creatd by removing *all* the
extension modules. If you remove all the docs as well, the final uncompressed size
is about 16 megabytes (depending on which version of Python your distirbution is for).

You can further reduce that by using `UPX <http://www.upx.org/>`_ to compress
the dlls and pyds.

.. note: ::

    To use **Movable Python** on Windows 98, with long path names, you will
    need to keep the ``win32api`` module.


win32 Extensions
----------------

The win32 extensions take up around five megabytes. If you don't use them it's
fine to delete them, although they're popular extensions and lots of other
software does use them.

``pywintypes24.dll`` and ``pythoncom24.dll`` are both part of the win32
extensions and can be deleted if you aren't going to use them.

The following directories are all part of the win32 extensions :

* isapi
* win32
* win32com
* win32comext

.. note::

    The ``win32api`` extension is needed under Windows 98.

Other Files
-----------

If your distribution will never run on a windows 98 computer, *or* never uses
unicode, you can get rid of ``unicows.dll``. 

On some computers you might not need the two other Microsoft dlls [#]_ - but a
clean install of XP *will* need them, they're not part of the
{acro;OS;Operating System}.

The copy of ``docs_html`` in the ``movpy`` folder is the one launched by
the **About** button on the GUI. If you delete this folder, the
`online version <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/movpy/about.html>`_ should
be launched instead.


UPX Compression
---------------

Another way of reducing distribution size is to use UPX_ to compress dlls, pyds,
and executables.

It's not something I've tried - but lots of people recommend it.
