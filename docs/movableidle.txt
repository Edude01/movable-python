**Movable IDLE** is a portable version of IDLE, the Python IDE that comes with Python. It is built with Python 2.4.3, and has the full Python standard library. This means that it should run *most* Python programs. 

It does lack most of the features of `Movable Python <index.html>`_, including the GUI launcher and some of the trickery. It should still be useful for educational purposes and experimenting with.

Like **Movable Python**, it easily fits on a USB stick or memory card.


Download
========

**Movable IDLE** can be downloaded from :

    `Movable IDLE Download <http://voidspace.tradebit.com/files.php/7007>`_

Here you can also download the free trial version of Movable Python. If you like or appreciate Movable IDLE, please purchase Movable Python.

Movable IDLE comes as a single zip file, which is about six megabytes compressed. Uncompressed it is fifteen megabytes.
 
Limitations
===========

**Movable IDLE** will run almost every program that can be run from IDLE. It does not have all the clever trickery that **Movable Python** does. This means that the `win32 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32>`_ extensions, or any program that uses ``imp.find_module`` are unlikely to work. It also won't work with programs that have another event loop, like other GUI toolkits.

If you need these features, try `Movable Python`_. {sm;:-)}

On the other hand, if you do find bugs or restrictions, post them to the `Movable Python Mailing List <http://groups.google.com/group/movpy>`_ and it may be possible to fix them.
