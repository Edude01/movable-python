This page describes the **Movable Python** distributions. Which one should you
buy, and what comes in the box ?

Which Distribution ?
====================

The decision as to which distribution you want depends entirely on which 
version of `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ you want to use.

* Python 2.5
* Python 2.4.4
* Python 2.3.5
* Python 2.2.3

The current version number is 2.0.0.

There is also a portable version of IDLE, called `Movable IDLE <movableidle.html>`_. 
This is built with Python 2.4.3 and comes with the full
Python standard library, but lacks a lot of the features of **Movable Python**.

What Comes in the Box
=====================

Each distribution is supplied as a single zipfile. Each zipfile contains a
single directory (``movpy-version``) with the following subdirectories :

1) **docs**
2) **docs_html**
3) **licenses**
4) **manuals**
5) **movpy**
6) **Firedrop2 Extras**

A normal distribution is quite big (around 60 megabytes). This is because of
all the extra libraries and tools that come with it. You can drastically
reduce this size by removing the ones you don't need. See 
`Customising Movable Python <reference/customising.html>`_ for details on how to do
this.


docs
----

This contains the text source files for **Movable Python**. These are intended
to be rendered using `rest2web <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/rest2web/>`_.

In addition to the document source files it contains :

* ``r2w.ini`` - the config file for rest2web to generate the {acro;HTML} 
  docs.

    You will need to edit the ``macros`` value to point to your macro file for
    this to work correctly.
    
* ``template.txt`` - the HTML template for the generated docs.


docs_html
---------

The **Movable Python** documentation in HTML format. This directory also
contains all the images and {acro;CSS} stylesheet needed.


licenses
--------

These are the licenses for the Python libraries and tools that come with
**Movable Python**.

The **Movable Python** license is part of the documentation.


manuals
-------

Documentation and manuals for some of the Python libraries and tools that come
with **Movable Python**.


movpy
-----

This is the distribution itself. It contains the executables ``movpy.exe`` and
``movpyw.exe``, as well as several dlls.

``movpyw.exe`` runs programs without the dos console box.

The ``lib`` directory is where the `Special Files`_ are
located. These allow you to customize the behaviour of **Movable Python**.


Firedrop2 Extras
----------------

This contains extra files used by the `macros <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/firedrop2/macros.html>`_
in `Firedrop2 <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/firedrop2/>`_.

These don't go in the main **Firedrop2** directory. You should follow the
instructions in the documentation on how to use them. The documentation is
included in the manuals_ folder.


Distribution Contents
=====================

Every **Movable Python** distribution comes with the full standard library. 
This means that it is capable of running any code that normal Python can. For 
an example of a large and complex program that runs under **Movable Python**, 
see `SPE <http://pythonide.stani.be>`_ the Python editor. {sm;:-)}

A `Movable Python User <http://blog.99hats.com/>`_ also reports running Zope
3.2 with **Movable Python**.

Also included are several additional libraries and tools. Below is the list of
packages and versions that are currently included:

.. note::

    For compatibility reasons it is not always possible to include all the
    packages (or the latest versions) in the Python 2.2 distributions.

    The list below notes any differences.


Python 2.5
----------

Several of the third party extensions included in **Movable Python** (like ctypes) are now a standard part of Python. For obvious reasons they're not included separately. {sm;:-)}

To see all the new extensions in Python 2.5, see `New, Improved, and Removed Modules <http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/modules.html>`_.


Python 2.4
----------

Python 2.4 come with the following tools and libraries :

* `psyco <http://psyco.sourceforge.net/>`_ - Version 1.5.2 - The 
  specialising compiler.

    The specializing compiler. Can be used to increase the speed of your
    Python programs.

    Through the GUI and command line you can turn psyco on for *all* programs
    that you run.

* `IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org/>`_ - 0.7.1.fix1

    IPython is the default interactive interpreter for **Movable Python**.

    It has many advanced features over the standard one - as well as
    providing many functions normally only available from a command line shell.

* `wxPython <http://www.wxpython.org/>`_ - 2.8.0-unicode - The wxWidgets
  based GUI toolkit.

    wxPython is the powerful GUI toolkit based on wxWidgets.

    It includes the standard wxPython tools like the `PyCrust Shell <http://wxpython.org/py.php>`_.

* `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_ - 0.4.0 - For rendering {acro;ReST;ReStructured Text} documents.

    The set of libraries used to ReST into HTML and LaYTex.

* `ctypes <http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/>`_ - 1.0.1 - A library to call {acro;dll;Dynamic Linked Libraries}s from Python.

    This is needed for readline support in IPython. ctypes interfaces Python to
    external libraries.

* `readline <http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncpythontools>`_ - 1.12 - A port of GNU readline.

    The port of GNU readline to the windows platform.

    Used by IPython.

* `Firedrop2 <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/firedrop2/>`_ - 0.2.2 - The Python blog client.

    The Python blog client. A fully featured tool for managing weblogs. It can
    also be used for managing document collections.

* `Wax <http://sourceforge.net/projects/waxgui>`_ - 0.3.33 - A toolkit making it easier to use wxPython.

    A wrapper layer that makes programming with wxPython a much more pleasant
    experience.

    Used by Firedrop.

* `pythonutils <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pythonutils>`_ - 0.2.5 - A package of Python programming modules.

    A python Package containing several modules that simplify common
    programming tasks.

* `PyEnchant <http://pyenchant.sourceforge.net/>`_ - 1.3.0 - A Python spell checker.

    A Python spell checker module. Used by Firedrop.

* `PyCrypto <http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto>`_ - 2.0.1 - Python cryptography toolkit.

    Python cryptography tools.

* `win32 extensions <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/>`_ - Build 210 - Windows module.

    A set of Windows extensions for Python. This includes the Pythonwin
    IDE.

* `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_ - 1.1.6 - The Python Imaging Library.

    Image manipulation from Python.

* `Pmw <http://pmw.sourceforge.net/>`_ - 1.2 - Python Megawidgets

IDLE, the Python editor in the standard library, is also included and works.
This uses the version of ``TKinter``/``Tcl`` that usually comes with that
version of Python.


Python 2.3
----------

* wxPython 2.8 is not available for Python 2.3. The version included in the Python 2.3 distribution is 2.6.3.3.

* Psyco 1.5.1


Python 2.2
----------

The Python 2.2 distributions don't include IPython/readline/ctypes as IPython can't
be made to work properly with python 2.2 (IPython requires a version of ctypes 
that isn't available for Python 2.2).

The last version of wxPython available for Python 2.2 is 2.5.3.1.

In addition, error reporting from python 2.2 is less good. This affects the
exec command we use to run scripts. It means that you may not get told which
file the error was raised in.

Some of the other libraries may not be fully compatible with Python 2.2. These
will either be removed or revert to earlier versions if unsolvable problems are
discovered.

Listed here are extensions which are different from the versions for the Python 2.4/2.3 distributions :

* wxPython 2.5.3.1 - The wxWidgets based GUI toolkit.

* Wax 0.3.27 - A toolkit making it easier to use wxPython.

* Psyco 1.5.1



Special Files
=============

As well as the program files, **Movable Python** has several files that control
its behaviour. You can control *most* of these through the `GUI <gui_manual.html>`_,
but you can also edit some of these by hand.

These are located in the ``lib`` directory.

Particularly, you might want to add paths to *syspaths.pth* (to add paths to
``sys.path``) or edit *customize.py* to customise the environment programs run
in.

See `Special Files`_ for details.
