Introduction
============

This page mentions all the people who have contributed to **Movable Python**,
and those responsible for the extra tools and packages included.

Movable Python
==============

**Movable Python** is written and maintained by Michael Foord. You can see (and
download) my other Python Projects at the
`Voidspace Python Pages <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/index.shtml>`_.

**Movable Python** is created using `py2exe <http://www.py2exe.org>`_. py2exe
was written by Thomas Heller and is maintained by Jimmy Retzlaff. Thanks to
both of them, especially for their help on the py2exe mailing list.

`Bruno Thoorens <http://bruno.thoorens.free.fr>`_ and
`Stani Michiels <http://pythonide.stani.be>`_ both contributed to
the original **Movable Python** project. You can see a list of their
contributions on the `Old Changelog <old_changelog.html>`_ page.

Thanks to Brian Beck, for help with sussing out issues related to the pywin32
extensions.

Thanks to James Norden, for the **Movable Python** image.

Thanks to John Davenport, for the silly **Python on a Stick** suggestion!

Thanks to Stephen Ferg for a donation to help make Movable Python open
source.

Useful suggestions have been made by Torsten Will and JimC, thanks.

Additional Tools
================

.. note::

    You can find licenses for the individual packages in the ``licenses``
    folder of the distribution.

Thanks to the following people, for the additional tools included with
**Movable Python** :

Armin Rigo for `psyco <http://psyco.sourceforge.net/>`_ - the specialising
compiler. Particularly, thanks for giving me permission to include psyco in the
distributions.

Mark Hammond for `pywin32 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32>`_ and the
Pythonwin IDE.

The `wxPython <http://www.wxpython.org>`_ team for their work. wxPython is the
python interface to the wxWidgets graphical toolkit.

Fernando Perez for `IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org/>`_. This is the most
actively developed shell environment for Python. It allows access to the normal
command line as well as the python environment (amongst many other goodies).

Gary Bishop for the '`readline <http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncpythontools>`_
for windows' module we include for use with IPython.

Guido Van Rossum for `Python <http://www.python.org>`_. (of course)

The `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_ team for
{acro;ReST;ReStructured Text} and docutils - making writing documentation a lot
easier.

Thomas Heller for `ctypes <http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/>`_.

`Firedrop2 <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/firedrop2/>`_ is written by
`Hans Nowak <http://zephyrfalcon.org>`_ and maintained by
`Michael Foord <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/index.shtml>`_.

`Wax <http://sourceforge.net/projects/waxgui>`_ is written by `Hans Nowak`_.

`pythonutils <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pythonutils>`_
is written by Michael Foord (me).

Ryan Kelly for `PyEnchant <http://pyenchant.sourceforge.net/>`_.

amk for `PyCrypto <http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto>`_.

Fredrik Lundh the author of `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_ .

I don't think I've missed anyone out. {sm;:-o}
