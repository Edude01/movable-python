Introduction
============

Some of the behavior of **Movable Python** is controlled by a few files in the
``lib`` directory.

You can configure :

1) The environment programs run in: `customize.py`_
2) Paths to add to ``sys.path``: `syspaths.pth`_
3) Various config files: stored in ``lib/config/``
4) The ``lib/config/logs/`` directory.
5) Your `IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org>`_ config options: `ipythonrc.ini`_

These files all use simple text based formats; they can be edited with any text
editor.

Some of these can be changed by the GUI, and are probably better *not* edited
by hand. See the individual sections for details.

.. note::

    The GUI can only save changes if it has write permission in the ``lib``
    directory.

    That means you can't save changes if your distribution is on a CD.


customize.py
============

This Python script is run (rather than imported) before every program is run. This
means you can edit it to customise the environment your scripts run in.

It is also run before entering interactive mode. (``-`` at the command line, or
the interpreter launched from the GUI.)

There is a module called ``movpy`` which you can import to give you access to
information about the environment the interpreter is running.

.. note::

    Note the spelling of the filename **customize.py**.

    Sorry for the inconsistentency in my spelling. {sm;:-o}

The movpy module defines the following names.

* ``filename`` : the path to the script we are running
* ``filedir`` : the directory that script is in
* ``movpydir`` : the directory of the movpy executable
* ``curdir`` : the cwd from which we have been called
* ``libdir`` : the 'lib' directory that modules/packages are contained in
* ``commandline`` : not equals to '' if '-c' was used at the command line
* ``go_interactive`` : True if '-i' was set.
* ``interactive`` : True if we are in an interactive session
* ``interactive_mode`` :  is a function to enter interactive mode 

    ``interactive_mode(localvars=None, globalvars=None, IPOFF=False, argv=None)``

* ``movpyw`` : True if we are running under movpyw rather than movpy

syspaths.pth
============

This file lets you specify directories to add to the module search path
(``sys.path``). 

If paths are specified as relative locations, they should be relative to the
'``lib/``' directory in which the path file lives. 

If you manually add a module into your lib directory that normally has a 
'``.pth``' file [#]_, then you will need to make an entry here. 

This includes modules like '``wx``', '``pyGTK'``, '``PIL``', etc. (Note that
win32 has particular complications. Read the instructions at `win32ext <win32ext.html>`_).

Copying the contents of the '``.pth``' file into ``syspaths.pth`` will usually
be sufficient.

.. note::

    ``.pth`` files can contain ``import`` statements. This isn't supported by **Movable Python**.


Config Files
============

The ``lib/config/`` directory contains various config files used by Movable Python.

These include :

* *config.txt* : The options saved by Movable Python. These can be set from the GUI and are always used by Movable Python unless you pass in the ``-o`` (override) `command line <command_line.html>`_ option.
* *file_history.txt* : The history of files you have launched from the GUI.
* *ide.txt* : The IDE launched by the `IDE <ide.html>`_ button.
* *initial_directory.txt* : The initial directory for the file open dialog.
* *logging.txt* : Your `logging <logging.html>`_ settings.
* *quicklaunch.txt* : The settings for your `Quick Launch <quick_launch.txt>`_ buttons. 


The Logs Directory
==================

The directory ``lib/config/logs/`` is the default location for files created by Movable Python logging_.

ipythonrc.ini
=============

This file is your configuration file for IPython_. IPython is very powerful and
flexible. See the manual in the '``manuals``' directory for details on how to
configure and use IPython to its best.

Footnotes
=========

.. [#] ``.pth`` files normally live in the ``site-packages`` folder, so it
       should be easy to see if a package has a ``.pth`` file.
.. [#] If you mess it up you will lose your settings. You have been warned. {sm;8)}
