**Movable Python** can be configured to use several different interpreters. You can configure Movable Python to use any executable program as an interpreter. This includes installed versions of Python, `IronPython <http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython>`_, or any other program.

Having configured your interpreters, you select the interpreter you want to use from the drop down list in the *Interpreter* menu.

The selected interpreter will be used to launch all programs. This means that Movable Python can act as a GUI front end for any program.

The '>>>' button will launch the interactive interpreter for the selected interpreter.

Currently the interpreter selection is *not* used for programs launched using the `Quick Launch <quick_launch.html>`_ buttons or for the IDE button.


Consoles
--------

When running programs, Movable Python can use the right executable for your console options for Movable Python interpreters, Python interpreters and IronPython.

For Movable Python the executables ``movpy.exe`` and ``movpyw.exe`` must be in the same directory.

For IronPython the executables ``ipy.exe`` and ``ipyw.exe`` must be in the same directory.

For Movable Python and normal Python interpreters, Movable Python knows which options it can use. For example, for Python the command line option ``-i``, ``-x`` and ``-u`` are valid. ``-f`` and ``-b`` are used for all interpreters.


Configuring Interpreters

To configure new interpreters with Movable Python, or edit existing ones, select the *Configure -> Interpreters* menu option. This brings up the configure dialog show above.

Click on *New* to create a new interpreter entry, or select a radio button from the left to edit an existing entry.

You can then choose an executable or batch file to be the new interpreter. You can even choose a Python script to be an interpreter. This allows you to use scripts like code quality tools, which take a filename as their argument, as Movable Python 'interpreters'. Python files setup as interpreters will be run with the default interpreter.

If your interpreter executable needs command line arguments *before* the filename, you can do this using quotes in the 'Executable' text box :

    ``"C:\Path\executable.exe" arg1 arg2``
    
(Quotes are *not* needed just because a path has spaces in it. Movable Python will handle this.)

Having edited an entry you must save it, using *Save Entry* in order to preserve your changes.

The *Register* button is used to setup an installed version of Python as an interpreter, see below.


Using Installed Python
======================

Movable Python can detect installed versions of Python and register them as interpreters.

* Create a new entry
* Click the *Register* button
* Select the installed Python to register
* Click Ok
* Save the entry
