**Movable Python** has various special features built into. When using the command line, these can be specified by `command line arguments <command_line.html>`_ passed to the ``movpy`` or ``movpyw`` executable.

The options dialog provides a way of controlling these from the GUI.

This dialog can be accessed from the `menu <menus.html#options>`_ or the `configure button <index.shtml#configure>`_.


Saved Options
=============

When you change options from this dialog you have the choice of choosing ``OK``, ``Save`` or ``Cancel``.

If you choose ``Save`` then these options will be set next time you run Movable Python.

These options are saved in one of the `Special Files <special_files.html>`_. They are also used when you run Movable Python from the command line (unless you use the ``-o`` override option).


The Options
===========

* ``f``

    Force scripts to run in their own directory, rather than the current directory.

* ``i``

    Drop into an interactive interpreter session when the program exits. (For non-Movable Python interpreters this will cause them to be run in a command console which drops down to the console after running.)


* ``p``

    Enable `psyco <http://psyco.sourceforge.net>`_ for Python scripts.

* ``u``

    Run Movable Python in 'unbuffered' mode.

* ``b``

    Pause (break) when the program exits. (For non-Movable Python interpreters this will cause them to be run in a command console which drops down to the console after running.)

* ``IPOFF``

    Do not use `IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org/>`_ for interactive interpreter sessions. If ``p`` is on *and* ``i`` is in use IPython will be off anyway.

* ``x``

    Skip the first line of the script.

The options ``u``, ``i`` and ``x`` also work when the interpreter in use is a normal Python interpreter.


The Console
===========

These radio buttons set the console options, in the same way as the `console menu <menus.html#console>`_.
