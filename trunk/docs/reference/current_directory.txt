Ok, so this dialog is so simple it barely warrants its own page. {sm;:-)}

Normally scripts will run in the current directory, or the directory they live in if you have the ``-f`` option set.

Sometimes you need to be able to specify the directory that scripts run in; this is the dialog to do it.

Leave the text box blank to run scripts in the current working directory, otherwise use the folder icon to choose a directory to run scripts in. The directory is stored as a path relative to your Movable Python directory.
