{emo;python} **Movable Python** is a distribution of Python, for Windows, that doesn't
need to be installed. It easily fits onto a {acro;USB;Universal Serial Bus}
memory stick or flash drive. Python on a stick [#]_. {sm;:-)}

It is integrated with the Pythonwin {acro;IDE;Integrated Development Environment},
to make **Movable Python** a portable *Build, Test, and Run* environment. It has
a nice {acro;GUI;Graphical User Interface} to launch programs and control its 
behaviour. At last you can carry a full development environment around with you.

**Movable Python** is useful in the following situations:

* Machines where you can't install programs.
* Creating a 'clean' installation of Python for testing programs.
* Where you need a portable '*Build, Test, and Run*' Python environment.
* Having several versions of Python on the same machine for forward / backward
  compatibility testing.
* Easily deploying Python scripts without having to install Python.
* Try before you buy - test Python without having to install it, including new
  versions .
* 'Python Runtime Environment'. '``.py``' files can be associated with movpy.

.. note::

    If you like **Movable Python**, don't forget to check out the other 
    `Voidspace Python Projects`_.


Usage
=====

**Movable Python** distributions come as a single zip file. For more details on the contents of this zipfile, see the `distributions page`_.

To use, unzip the contents and open the ``movpy`` directory. If you doubleclick on ``movpyw.exe`` it will bring up the `GUI launcher <reference/gui_manual.html>`_. You can use this to launch scripts, the interpreter or an IDE.

From the command line, you can use ``movpy.exe`` and ``movpyw.exe`` in the same way as you would use ``python.exe and ``pythonw.exe``. See the page on the `command line <reference/command_line.html>`_ for more details of the command line options available.


Distributions
=============

The distributions come with the full Python standard library. They also include
several tools and add-on libraries.

There are five different distributions available :

* Python 2.2.3
* Python 2.3.5
* Python 2.4.4
* Python 2.5.0

Each distribution comes with several popular third party extendion modules, like `pywin32 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32>`_, `wxPython <http://www.wxpython.org>`_ and `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_ (plus lots more). For a full list of all the extension modules included, see the `distributions page <distributions.html>`_.

If you would like to see your favourite extension or tool included in this list,
`contact me <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cgi-bin/contact/contact.py>`_ or post
suggestions on the `Mailing List`_.

It is easy to add further extension modules to your **Movable Python** distribution. See `Customising Your Distribution <reference/customising.html>`_.

There is also a portable version of IDLE, called `Movable IDLE <movableidle.html>`_
available for free download. This is built with Python 2.4.3 and comes with the full
Python standard library, but lacks a lot of the features of **Movable Python**.


Support and Compatibility
=========================

**Movable Python** is under active development, and will continue to improve.
You can see some of the new features that may be added on the `TODO Page <TODO.html>`_.

**Movable Python** contains the full Python interpreter and standard library.
This means that it is capable of running any code that normal Python can. For
an example of a large and complex program that runs under **Movable Python**,
see `SPE <http://pythonide.stani.be>`_ the Python editor. {sm;:-)}

A lot of work has gone into ensuring that programs run with **Movable Python**
run in the same environment as a normal Python program. There are still some
very slight differences. See the `ISSUES Page <ISSUES.html>`_ for more details
on these.

Any problems (programs not running) are *likely* to be with third party
extension modules.

Usually only with:

* Modules that make registry entries when they are installed.
* Modules that assume the Python executable name or rely on the directory
  structure of a normal installation.
* Modules that attempt to detect when they are running in a frozen environment
  and behave differently.

These cases are uncommon and usually resolvable.

* Bug reports
* Feature requests
* Suggestions
* Questions
