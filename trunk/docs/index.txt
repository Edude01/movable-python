    *Movable Python has the potential to affect your programming 
    life even more than Microsoft's embrace.  Yes, it's that 
    important.*

Python on a Stick
=================

{emo;python} **Movable Python** is a distribution of Python for Windows that doesn't
need to be installed. It easily fits onto a USB
memory stick or flash drive. Python on a stick. {sm;:-)}

It includes an {acro;IDE;Integrated Development Environment} and many common Python extensions, to make
**Movable Python** a portable *Build, Test, and Run* environment. It has a nice
{acro;GUI;Graphical User Interface} to launch programs and control its 
behaviour.

**Movable Python** is useful in the following situations:

* Machines where you can't install programs.
* Creating a sandboxed installation of Python for testing programs.
* Where you need a portable '*Build, Test, and Run*' Python environment.
* Having several versions of Python on the same machine for forward/backward
  compatibility testing.
* Easily deploying Python scripts without having to install Python.
* Try before you buy - test Python without having to install it, including new
  versions.
* 'Python Runtime Environment'. '``.py``' files can be associated with movpy.

For more examples of how you can use **Movable Python**, see the `Use Cases <use_cases.html>`_
page.

**Movable Python** can be used to launch scripts with several different
interpreters from a single interface. It can detect an installed version of
Python and you can switch between that and any Movpy interpreters you may have,
including passing command line arguments and configuring Movpy [#]_.

As well as launching Python scripts, you can use **Movable Python** as a
graphical front end to any program. You may never need to use the command
line again. {sm;:wink:}

For a fuller introduction to **Movable Python**,
read the `Introduction <introduction.html>`_ or ask on the
`Mailing List <http://groups.google.com/group/movpy/>`_.

For instructions on how to use **Movable Python**, you might want to visit
`The Reference Manual <reference/index.html>`_.

    <p>{small;Oh, and by the way, it's <em>Movable Python</em>, not <em>Moveable Python</em>.}</p>

.. [#] Features of **Movable Python** include the ability to log the output
       of all files you run with it, and to enable `psyco <http://psyco.sourceforge.net>`_.
